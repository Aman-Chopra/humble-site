        Humble is a company formed by a group of like minded software development professionals.
        We had our thoughts about how should a business should be and how software development services should be.
        We came together to create this company to see our ideolgies of
        humbleness, honesty and quality software development realized
        - in terms of good customer service for our customers and in terms of growth of us as a company and as individuals.
